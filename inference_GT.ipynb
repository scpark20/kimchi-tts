      "In fact, he had looked at twenty very much as he looked at sixty, lacking a little of the grayness.\n",
      "Did you ever have an ache like that, mr Cuthbert?\"\n",
      "It's certain I'll never be angelically good.\n",
      "Something still pleasanter may come after, but you can never be sure.\n",

      "\"Thank you.\n",
      "The princess did not appear to understand him, for she retorted his question:--\n",

      "\"You naughty, naughty, NAUGHTY, NAUGHTY man!\" she cried.\n",

      "I pity you.\"\n",

      "But I don't care.\n",

      "Put me in.\"\n",
      "You must sit and look at me, else I shall not be able to keep up.\"\n",
      "She did not care who the man was; that was nothing to her.\n",
      "I'm afloat!\"\n",
      "\"There, then,\" said she, holding out the wine to him.\n",
      "But the prince felt better.\n",
      "The princess gave a shriek, and sprang into the lake.\n",
      "\"Now you can go.\"\n",
      "They bore her across to the stone where they had already placed a little boat for her.\n",
      "\"Here I am,\" said the prince.\n",
      "When she saw it she shrieked, and covered her face with her hands.\n",
      "\"Well?\" said she, without looking round.\n",
      "In a few minutes the prince appeared.\n",
      "\"Put me in.\"\n",
      "And the little boat bumped against the stone.\n",
      "\"Hold your tongue,\" answered the Dervish.\n",
      "THE CONCLUSION.\n",
      "You know----\"\n",
      "\"I had a wish to break this mr Birch of his unsocial habits, and gave him a call this morning,\" he said.\n",
      "The trooper rose instantly from the table, exclaiming,--\n",
      "\"If I catch him,\" cried the dragoon, while buttering another cake, \"he will dangle from the limbs of one of his namesakes.\"\n",
      "It was glittering with the opening brilliancy of one of those lovely, mild days, which occur about the time of the falling of the leaf; and which, by their frequency, class the American autumn with the most delightful seasons of other countries.\n",
      "\"That is strange, too,\" said the trooper, looking at the disconcerted host intently, \"considering he is your next neighbor; he must be quite domestic, sir; and to the ladies it must be somewhat inconvenient.\n",
      "He bowed again politely as he reentered the room, and walking up to Captain Wharton, said, with comic gravity,--\n",
      "On getting sufficiently near, however, to a body of horse of more than double his own number, to distinguish countenances, Lawton plunged his rowels into his charger, and in a moment he was by the side of his commander.\n",
      "\"He would make no bad ornament, suspended from one of those locusts before his own door,\" added the lieutenant.\n",
      "Frances ventured to throw a timid glance at his figure as he entered, and saw at once the man from whose scrutiny Harvey Birch had warned them there was so much to be apprehended.\n",
      "\"This gentleman!\" repeated the other, turning to Captain Wharton, and contemplating his figure for a moment until the anxiety of his countenance gave place to a lurking smile.\n",
      "\"Sir, your anxiety for your friend excuses your language,\" said Lawton, haughtily; \"but you forget I am a Virginian, and a gentleman.\" Turning to the young man, he continued, \"Were you ignorant, Captain Wharton, that our pickets have been below you for several days?\"\n",
      "Leave him with us; there is no reward, no sum, which I will not cheerfully pay.\"\n",
      "\"I cannot, without violating the truth, say it is,\" returned the dragoon.\n",
      "\"Had I found him within, I should have placed him where he would enjoy life in the midst of society, for a short time at least.\"\n",
      "\"I came out, as my father has mentioned, to see my friends, understanding your parties to be at Peekskill, and near the Highlands, or surely I would not have ventured.\"\n",
      "With the exception of the sentinels left to guard Captain Wharton, the dragoons mounted, and marched out to meet their comrades.\n",
      "None of the watchfulness, which was so necessary to their situation, was neglected by the wary partisan. Patrols were seen on the distant hills, taking their protecting circuit around their comrades, who were enjoying, in the midst of danger, a security that can only spring from the watchfulness of discipline and the indifference of habit.\n",
      "In a few moments orders were given to some of the troops, and horsemen left the valley, at full speed, by its various roads.\n",
      "\"Run!\" repeated the British officer, gathering himself up in military pride.\n",
      "Her dread on behalf of her brother was certainly greatly diminished; yet her form shook, her breathing became short and irregular, and her whole frame gave tokens of extraordinary agitation. Her eyes rose from the floor to the dragoon, and were again fixed immovably on the carpet-she evidently wished to utter something but was unequal to the effort.\n",
      "The necessity of a supply from the dominion of Dinah soon, however, afforded another respite, of which Lawton availed himself.\n",
      "As yet none of the family had sufficient presence of mind to devise any means of security for Captain Wharton; but the danger now became too pressing to admit of longer delay, and various means of secreting him were hastily proposed; but they were all haughtily rejected by the young man, as unworthy of his character.\n",
      "The heavy tread of the trooper, as he followed the black to the door of the parlor, rang in the ears of the females as it approached nearer and nearer, and drove the blood from their faces to their hearts, with a chill that nearly annihilated feeling.\n",
      "\"And congress a halter,\" continued the commanding officer commencing anew on a fresh supply of the cakes.\n",
      "\"Why,\" said the captain, laughing, \"I do acknowledge a little inquietude myself-but how was it with you?\" turning to his younger and evidently favorite sister, and tapping her cheek.\n",
      "September, October, even November and December, compose the season for enjoyment in the open air; they have their storms, but they are distinct, and not of long continuance, leaving a clear atmosphere and a cloudless sky.\n",
      "\"If he is poor, King George is a bad paymaster.\"\n",
      "None of the watchfulness necessary in a war, in which similarity of language, appearance, and customs rendered prudence doubly necessary, was omitted by the cautious leader.\n",
      "\"But he is gone-how-when-and whither?\"\n",
      "Acquainted with all the passes of the hills, and indefatigable in the discharge of his duty, the trooper had, with much trouble and toil, succeeded in effecting his object.\n",
      "\"Expresses are already on the road to announce to him our situation, and the intelligence will speedily bring him to this valley; unless, indeed, some private reasons may exist to make a visit particularly unpleasant.\"\n",
      "\"We shall always be happy to see Major Dunwoodie.\"\n",
      "Through Solway sands, through Taross moss, Blindfold, he knew the paths to cross: By wily turns, by desperate bounds, Had baffled Percy's best bloodhounds. In Eske, or Liddel, fords were none, But he would ride them, one by one; Alike to him was time or tide, December's snow or July's pride; Alike to him was tide or time, Moonless midnight or matin prime. --WALTER SCOTT.\n",
      "\"I did not know it until I reached them, and it was then too late to retreat,\" said Wharton sullenly.\n",
      "\"You have no cause for alarm, ladies,\" said the officer, pausing a moment, and contemplating the pale faces around him.\n",
      "Two or three of the dragoons now dismounted and disappeared; in a few minutes, however, they returned to the yard, followed by Katy, from whose violent gesticulations, it was evident that matters of no trifling concern were on the carpet.\n",
      "\"Upon my word, you improve most rapidly in externals,\" added the trooper, preserving his muscles in inflexible gravity.\n",
      "The dragoon looked at him for a minute with the drollery that characterized his manner, and then continued,--\n",
      "He is not a spy; nothing but a desire to see his friends prompted him to venture so far from the regular army in disguise.\n",
      "All the members of the Wharton family laid their heads on their pillows that night, with a foreboding of some interruption to their ordinary quiet.\n",
      "When treason reaches the grade of general officers, Captain Wharton, it behooves the friends of liberty to be vigilant.\"\n",
      "\"What is the offense of poor Birch?\" asked Miss Peyton, handing the dragoon a fourth dish of coffee.\n",
      "\"mr Harper,\" echoed the other, feeling a load removed from his heart, \"yes, I had forgotten; but he is gone; and if there be anything wrong in his character, we are in entire ignorance of it; to me he was a total stranger.\"\n",
      "In advance, with an officer, was a man attired in the dress of a countryman, who pointed in the direction of the cottage.\n",
      "The countenance of Lawton changed instantly, and his assumed quaintness vanished.\n",
      "\"I prefer your ebony hair, from which you seem to have combed the powder with great industry.\n",
      "Still, the expression of his eye, though piercing, was not bad, and his voice, though deep and powerful, was far from unpleasant.\n",
      "A twelvemonth had not yet elapsed, since Birch had been seen lingering near the headquarters of the commander in chief, and at a time when important movements were expected hourly to occur.\n",
      "\"My business will be confined to a few questions, which, if freely answered, will instantly remove us from your dwelling.\"\n",
      "Miss Peyton was a close observer of these movements of her niece, and advancing with an air of feminine dignity, inquired,--\n",
      "It was my mistake; you will please to pardon it.\"\n",
      "\"You appear so close an observer of things, I should like your opinion of it, sir,\" said Henry, removing the silk, and exhibiting the cheek free from blemish.\n",
      "\"This gentleman-here-favored us with his company during the rain, and has not yet departed.\"\n"

      "\"Never mind,\" continued the captain; \"I will have him yet before I'm a major.\"\n",
      "He viewed the figure of Captain Wharton, as he stood proudly swelling with a pride that disdained further concealment, and exclaimed with great earnestness,--\n",
      "\"No, mr Caesar, running is not my trade.\" While speaking, he walked deliberately to the window, where the family were already collected in the greatest consternation.\n",
      "The ladies left the table to their guests, who proceeded, without much superfluous diffidence, to do proper honors to the hospitality of mr Wharton.\n",
      "On reaching the road which led through the bottom of the valley, they turned their horses' heads to the north.\n",
      "As nothing could be seen likely to interrupt the enjoyments and harmony of such a day, the sisters descended to the parlor, with a returning confidence in their brother's security, and their own happiness.\n",
      "Nothing remained now, but to meet the impending examination with as much indifference as the family could assume.\n",
      "At length Captain Lawton suspended for a moment his violent attacks on the buckwheat cakes, to inquire of the master of the house, if there was not a peddler of the name of Birch who lived in the valley at times.\n",
      "We have no spring; vegetation seems to leap into existence, instead of creeping, as in the same latitudes of the Old World; but how gracefully it retires!\n",
      "\"Dunwoodie!\" exclaimed Frances, with a face in which the roses contended for the mastery with the paleness of apprehension.\n",
      "The two subalterns struggled to conceal their smiles; but the captain resumed his breakfast with an eagerness that created a doubt, whether he ever expected to enjoy another.\n",
      "\"I fancied it then, from seeing you had covered such handsome black locks with that ugly old wig.\n",
      "Captain Lawton never could forgive the deception; his antipathies to his enemies were not very moderate, but this was adding an insult to his penetration that rankled deeply.\n",
      "The officers were invited to take their morning's repast at the family breakfast table, and having made their arrangements without, the invitation was frankly accepted.\n",
      "Young Wharton very composedly did as was required and stood an extremely handsome, well dressed young man.\n",
      "\"You have but little to apprehend from his character,\" answered the dragoon dryly.\n",
      "The captain himself moved his hand involuntarily to his head, and discovered that the trepidation of his sisters had left some of his natural hair exposed.\n",
      "Lawton regarded her with a mingled expression of pity and admiration; then shaking his head doubtingly, he continued,--\n",
      "At length his sisters, with trembling hands, replaced his original disguise, the instruments of which had been carefully kept at hand by Caesar, in expectation of some sudden emergency.\n",
      "\"Oh! doubtless; he is a general favorite, May I presume on it so far as to ask leave to dismount and refresh my men, who compose a part of his squadron?\"\n",
      "\"I!\" exclaimed the captain, in surprise; \"I have no cold in my head.\"\n",
      "\"Run-Massa Harry-run-if he love old Caesar, run-here come a rebel horse.\"\n",
      "His dark hair hung around his brow in profusion, though stained with powder which was worn at that day, and his face was nearly hid in the whiskers by which it was disfigured.\n",
      "A man, whose colossal stature manifested the possession of vast strength, entered the room, and removing his cap, he saluted the family with a mildness his appearance did not indicate as belonging to his nature.\n",
      "I doubt not that that muslin in the window seat cost twice as much as he would have asked them for it.\"\n",
      "It was too late to retreat to the woods in the rear of the cottage, for he would unavoidably be seen, and, followed by a troop of horse, as inevitably taken.\n",
      "\"Quick, gentlemen, to your horses; there comes Dunwoodie,\" and, followed by his officers, he precipitately left the room.\n",
      "Henry bowed to this remark in distant silence, but Sarah ventured to urge something in behalf of her brother.\n",
      "The leader of the horse dismounted, and, followed by a couple of his men, he approached the outer door of the building, which was slowly and reluctantly opened for his admission by Caesar.\n",
      "\"And where might that be, sir?\" asked mr Wharton, conceiving it necessary to say something.\n",
      "A short communication with the loquacious housekeeper followed the arrival of the main body of the troop, and the advance party remounting, the whole moved towards the Locusts with great speed.\n",
      "Afterwards, neither woman nor peddler was to be found.\n",
      "The dragoon watched the movement with a continued smile, when, seeming to recollect himself, turning to the father, he proceeded,--\n",
      "\"Captain Wharton, from my soul I pity you!\"\n",
      "He approached the youth with an air of comic gravity, and with a low bow, continued, \"I am sorry for the severe cold you have in your head, sir.\"\n",
      "CHAPTER five\n",
      "\"Did you see banners in the clouds, and mistake Miss Peyton's Aeolian harp for rebellious music?\"\n",
      "So soon as the information of this fact was communicated to the officer whose duty it was to guard the avenues of the American camp, he dispatched Captain Lawton in pursuit of the peddler.\n",
      "In fact, no small part of the bitterness expressed by Captain Lawton against the peddler, arose from the unaccountable disappearance of the latter, when intrusted to the custody of two of his most faithful dragoons.\n",
      "\"She did, indeed, Louisa.\n",
      "\"With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it.\"\n",
      "\"Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office.\"\n",
      "Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no beauty.\n",
      "\"Yes, all of them, I think.\n",
      "Chapter eight\n",
      "\"It ought to be good,\" he replied, \"it has been the work of many generations.\"\n",
      "And so extremely accomplished for her age!\n",
      "\"Neglect!\n",
      "Miss Bingley was engrossed by mr Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for mr Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at cards; who, when he found her to prefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.\n",
      "\"All this she must possess,\" added Darcy, \"and to all this she must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading.\"\n",
      "\"Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it.\"\n",
      "Her hair, so untidy, so blowsy!\"\n",
      "\"I wish it may.\"\n",
      "To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend's vulgar relations.\n",
      "At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner.\n",
      "\"I am talking of possibilities, Charles.\"\n",
      "Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice.\"\n",
      "\"It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,\" said Bingley.\n",
      "\"That is capital,\" added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.\n",
      "Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.\"\n",
      "\"She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent walker.\n",
      "A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but half deserved.\"\n",
      "\"And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying books.\"\n",
      "She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, or rather taller.\"\n",
      "\"But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world,\" replied Darcy.\n",
      "\"Certainly not.\"\n",
      "\"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?\" said Miss Bingley; \"will she be as tall as I am?\"\n",
      "\"Do you prefer reading to cards?\" said he; \"that is rather singular.\"\n",
      "Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared that they were miserable.\n",
      "She is a great reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.\"\n",
      "But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.\"\n",
      "\"I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these.\"\n",
      "mrs Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description, when mr Hurst called them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward.\n",
      "Such a countenance, such manners!\n",
      "His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others.\n",
      "On entering the drawing room she found the whole party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below, with a book.\n",
      "They all paint tables, cover screens, and net purses.\n",
      "Elizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her very little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near the card table, and stationed herself between mr Bingley and his eldest sister, to observe the game.\n",
      "I could hardly keep my countenance.\n",
      "Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards the table where a few books were lying.\n",
      "Bingley urged mr Jones being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians.\n",
      "With a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her room on leaving the dining parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee. She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep, and when it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go downstairs herself.\n",
      "\"I am astonished,\" said Miss Bingley, \"that my father should have left so small a collection of books.\n",
      "But with such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no chance of it.\"\n",
      "\"Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,\" said Darcy, \"has too much truth.\n",
      "Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and that she could not leave her.\n",
      "But that gentleman,\" looking at Darcy, \"seemed to think the country was nothing at all.\"\n",
      "\"Yes, she called yesterday with her father.\n"

      "She would not listen, therefore, to her daughter's proposal of being carried home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all advisable.\n",

      "\"I am sure,\" she added, \"if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest temper I have ever met with.\n",

      "I fancy she was wanted about the mince pies.\n",
      "\"You quite mistook mr Darcy.\n",
      "Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, mrs Bennet would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield.\n",
      "\"Yes, indeed,\" cried mrs Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood.\n",
      "\"Indeed I have, sir,\" was her answer.\n",
      "\"You begin to comprehend me, do you?\" cried he, turning towards her.\n",

      "mrs Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.\n",

      "My mother is not given to complaints,' said he, a little proudly. 'But so much the more I have to watch over you.\n",
      "But she must know of those days.' Margaret's manner had an extra tinge of coldness in it when she next spoke.\n",
      "It must have been an heir loom, and shows that she had ancestors.' So the owner of the ancestral lace became worthy of something more than the languid exertion to be agreeable to a visitor, by which mrs Hale's efforts at conversation would have been otherwise bounded.\n",
      "'If it has been mrs Thornton's home for some years, I can well understand her loving it,' said Margaret, in her clear bell like voice.\n",
      "'If I can find it out, I will.\n",
      "'Very probably,' said mrs Thornton, in a short displeased manner.\n",
      "As Fanny had put it, it did seem as if they had been impertinently discussing mrs Thornton's feelings; but she also rose up against that lady's manner of showing that she was offended.\n",

      "'I merely thought, that as strangers newly come to reside in a town which has risen to eminence in the country, from the character and progress of its peculiar business, you might have cared to visit some of the places where it is carried on; places unique in the kingdom, I am informed.\n",

      "It's in the same direction, and she's always so glad to see you.\n",
      "Her son had given her a carriage; but she refused to let him keep horses for it; they were hired for the solemn occasions, when she paid morning or evening visits.\n",

      "'It will do you good, instead of harm.\n",
      "As dinner giving, and as criticising other people's dinners, she took satisfaction in it.\n",

      "'Not quite, yet.\n",
      "He went abruptly out of the room after saying this.\n",
      "'No!' said Margaret. 'I have not seen anything of that description as yet.' Then she felt that, by concealing her utter indifference to all such places, she was hardly speaking with truth; so she went on:\n",
      "mrs Hale was making rather more exertion in her answers, captivated by some real old lace which mrs Thornton wore; 'lace,' as she afterwards observed to Dixon, 'of that old English point which has not been made for this seventy years, and which cannot be bought.\n",
      "But I have never been ill myself, so I am not much up to invalids' fancies.'\n",
      "'I am fond of hearing good music; I cannot play well myself; and papa and mamma don't care much about it; so we sold our old piano when we came here.'\n",

      "I always have a large order to give to Johnson's, the day after a concert.'\n",
      "But surely, it is a very easy journey to London.'\n",
      "mr Thornton looked annoyed.\n",
      "mrs Thornton was shy.\n",
      "'Nonsense, john.\n",
      "'Do you like new music simply for its newness, then?'\n",
      "His mother's eyes were bent on her work, at which she was now stitching away busily.\n",
      "It was only of late years that she had had leisure enough in her life to go into society; and as society she did not enjoy it.\n",
      "She was ill at ease, and looked more than usually stern and forbidding as she entered the Hales' little drawing room.\n",
      "I remember once going in a lilac silk to see candles made, and my gown was utterly ruined.'\n",
      "She is very proud of Milton; dirty, smoky place, as I feel it to be.\n",
      "'Oh, but I will send her home in a cab.\n",
      "I am going to morrow.\n",
      "It almost seems to me a necessary of life.'\n",
      "'What are you saying about me, Miss Hale?\n",
      "'It will be a long way for her to walk back at night!' she remarked, at last.\n",
      "A stranger, a careless observer might have considered that mrs Thornton's manner to her children betokened far more love to Fanny than to john.\n",
      "'Fanny, don't speak so of your brother.\n",
      "Yet Crampton was too far off for her to walk; and she had repeatedly questioned her son as to whether his wish that she should call on the Hales was strong enough to bear the expense of cab hire.\n",
      "'Fifteen shillings a week, and three saved out of them!' thought Margaret to herself 'But she must have been very young.\n",
      "She made all these reflections as she was talking in her stately way to mrs Hale, and uttering all the stereotyped commonplaces that most people can find to say with their senses blindfolded.\n",
      "She could not bear it.' mrs Thornton was silent after this; for her last words bore relation to a subject which mortified her.\n",
      "Margaret had not the words ready for an answer to this question, which took her a little by surprise, so Miss Thornton replied:\n",
      "But one is sure to hear the newest music there.\n",
      "I only wanted you exactly to understand about it.'\n",
      "MORNING CALLS\n",
      "'Yes! ever since I read the Tales of the Alhambra.\n",
      "He has good reasons of some kind or other, or he would not wish us to go.\n",
      "She would have been thankful if it had not; for, as she said, 'she saw no use in making up friendships and intimacies with all the teachers and masters in Milton; why, he would be wanting her to call on Fanny's dancing master's wife, the next thing!'\n",
      "'If you are going to morrow, I shall order horses.'\n",
      "And presently, Margaret, racking her brain to talk to Fanny, heard her mother and mrs Thornton plunge into the interminable subject of servants.\n",
      "She had an unconscious contempt for a weak character; and Fanny was weak in the very points in which her mother and brother were strong.\n",
      "But such a one would have been deeply mistaken.\n",
      "Make haste and put your things on.'\n",
      "'Well! here is Fanny then, who is seldom without an ailment.\n",
      "But I really do not find much pleasure in going over manufactories.'\n",
      "'Fanny!\n",
      "You could go on there while I am at mrs Hale's.'\n",
      "The directors admit so indiscriminately.\n",
      "Margaret was busy embroidering a small piece of cambric for some little article of dress for Edith's expected baby-'Flimsy, useless work,' as mrs Thornton observed to herself.\n",
      "Don't you know them?'\n",
      "Now as for Fanny there, a little hardship would do her good.'\n",
      "'She is not made of the same stuff as you are, john.\n",
      "'You have good concerts here, I believe.'\n",
      "Margaret was vexed.\n",
      "'Thank you,' said mrs Thornton.\n",
      "'I do not feel that my very natural liking for the place where I was born and brought up,--and which has since been my residence for some years, requires any accounting for.'\n",
      "'With what?' asked mrs Thornton, her brow slightly contracting.\n",
      "'I have not always an ailment,' said Fanny, pettishly; 'and I am not going with mamma.\n",
      "'I don't know-the weather, I think.\n",
      "The carriage could fetch her, and she could spend the rest of the day here, which I know she would like.'\n",
      "The mother looks very ill, and seems a nice, quiet kind of person.'\n",
      "'Yes; but somehow,' said Fanny, lowering her voice, 'mamma has never been to London herself, and can't understand my longing.\n",
      "mr Thornton had had some difficulty in working up his mother to the desired point of civility.\n",
      "mrs Thornton went on after a moment's pause:\n",
      "She liked mrs Hale's double knitting far better; that was sensible of its kind.\n",
      "One would think you were made of money.'\n",
      "'Oh! mamma, it's such a long way, and I am so tired.'\n",
      "'I thought I was doing my duty by talking to her, and trying to amuse her.'\n",
      "'john always speaks as if I fancied I was ill, and I am sure I never do fancy any such thing.\n",
      "'They are very curious places,' said mrs Hale, 'but there is so much noise and dirt always.\n",
      "Couldn't you bring nurse here, mamma?\n",
      "'Fanny dear I shall have horses to the carriage to day, to go and call on these Hales.\n",
      "'Oh! you need not speak so hastily.\n",
      "I need hardly say, that if there is any little thing that could serve mrs Hale as an invalid, you will offer it, I'm sure.'\n",
      "She will be able to suggest something, perhaps-won't you, Fan?'\n",
      "'Mother!\n",
      "Too crowded, that is the worst.\n",
      "I never thought of her walking.' At this point, mr Thornton came in, just before going to the mill.\n",
      "But this going to make acquaintance with strangers was a very different thing.\n",
      "'I think I should like to know all about them, if I were you,' replied Margaret quietly.\n",
      "Who are these Hales that he makes such a fuss about?'\n",
      "He would be depressed for many days after witnessing a death bed, or hearing of any crime.\n",
      "Thomson's Seasons, Hayley's Cowper, Middleton's Cicero, were by far the lightest, newest, and most amusing.\n",
      "The bones of his face were plainly to be seen-too plainly for beauty, if his features had been less finely cut; as it was, they had a grace if not a comeliness of their own.\n",
      "Margaret was painfully struck by the worn, anxious expression; and she went back over the open and avowed circumstances of her father's life, to find the cause for the lines that spoke so plainly of habitual distress and depression.\n",
      "This did good for a time; but when the autumn drew on, and the weather became more changeable, her mother's idea of the unhealthiness of the place increased; and she repined even more frequently that her husband, who was more learned than mr Hume, a better parish priest than mr Houldsworth, should not have met with the preferment that these two former neighbours of theirs had done.\n",
      "If the look on her face was, in general, too dignified and reserved for one so young, now, talking to her father, it was bright as the morning,--full of dimples, and glances that spoke of childish gladness, and boundless hope in the future.\n",
      "In the latter half of September, the autumnal rains and storms came on, and Margaret was obliged to remain more in the house than she had hitherto done.\n",
      "His face returned into its lines of habitual anxiety.\n",
      "She was ready with a bright smile, in which there was not a trace of fatigue, to greet her father when he awakened.\n"

      "She knew, and had rather revelled in the idea, that she should have to give up many luxuries, which had only been troubles and trammels to her freedom in Harley Street.\n",
      "I don't like shoppy people.\n",
      "In one of the letters she had received before leaving Harley Street, her father had told her that they had heard from Frederick; he was still at Rio, and very well in health, and sent his best love to her; which was dry bones, but not the living intelligence she longed for.\n",
      "But now Margaret noticed an absence of mind, as if his thoughts were pre occupied by some subject, the oppression of which could not be relieved by any daily action, such as comforting the survivors, or teaching at the school in hope of lessening the evils in the generation to come.\n",
      "Her mother-her mother always so kind and tender towards her-seemed now and then so much discontented with their situation; thought that the bishop strangely neglected his episcopal duties, in not giving mr Hale a better living; and almost reproached her husband because he could not bring himself to say that he wished to leave the parish, and undertake the charge of a larger.\n",
      "mr Hale was one of the most delightful preachers she had ever heard, and a perfect model of a parish priest.\n",
      "ROSES AND THORNS\n",
      "Her eyes began to see, not visions of what had been, but the sight actually before her; her dear father leaning back asleep in the railway carriage.\n",
      "But the evenings were rather difficult to fill up agreeably.\n",
      "With the healthy shame of a child, she blamed herself for her keenness of sight, in perceiving that all was not as it should be there.\n",
      "Accordingly, she was busy preparing her board one morning, when Sarah, the housemaid, threw wide open the drawing room door and announced, 'mr\n",
      "She remained with her, and was devoted to her interests; always considering herself as the good and protecting fairy, whose duty it was to baffle the malignant giant, mr Hale.\n",
      "I'm glad we don't visit them.\n",
      "I am so glad I am going home, to be at hand to comfort him and mamma.\n",
      "I'm sure you don't want me to admire butchers and bakers, and candlestick makers, do you, mamma?'\n",
      "CHAPTER two\n",
      "And walk Margaret did, in spite of the weather.\n",
      "Her out of doors life was perfect.\n",
      "Its people were her people.\n",
      "'Very well.\n",
      "Margaret could not help believing that there had been some late intelligence of Frederick, unknown to her mother, which was making her father anxious and uneasy.\n",
      "If mrs Shaw had guessed at the real reason why mrs Hale did not accompany her husband, she would have showered down gowns upon her; but it was nearly twenty years since mrs Shaw had been the poor, pretty Miss Beresford, and she had really forgotten all grievances except that of the unhappiness arising from disparity of age in married life, on which she could descant by the half hour.\n",
      "His spirits were always tender and gentle, readily affected by any small piece of intelligence concerning the welfare of others.\n",
      "'It is undoubtedly one of the most out of the way places in England,' said mrs Hale, in one of her plaintive moods.\n",
      "So he withdrew, while the children were yet young, into his library, to spend his evenings (if he were at home), in reading the speculative and metaphysical books which were his delight.\n",
      "Her in doors life had its drawbacks.\n",
      "The book shelves did not afford much resource. Margaret told her mother every particular of her London life, to all of which mrs Hale listened with interest, sometimes amused and questioning, at others a little inclined to compare her sister's circumstances of ease and comfort with the narrower means at Helstone vicarage.\n",
      "'Oh! if Frederick had but been a clergyman, instead of going into the navy, and being lost to us all!\n",
      "At one time they had tried backgammon as a resource; but as mr Hale grew to take an increasing interest in his school and his parishioners, he found that the interruptions which arose out of these duties were regarded as hardships by his wife, not to be accepted as the natural conditions of his profession, but to be regretted and struggled against by her as they severally arose.\n",
      "I call mine a very comprehensive taste; I like all people whose occupations have to do with land; I like soldiers and sailors, and the three learned professions, as they call them.\n",
      "HEMANS.\n",
      "Margaret was once more in her morning dress, travelling quietly home with her father, who had come up to assist at the wedding.\n",
      "When Margaret had been here before, she had brought down with her a great box of books, recommended by masters or governess, and had found the summer's day all too short to get through the reading she had to do before her return to town.\n",
      "But the cloud never comes in that quarter of the horizon from which we watch for it.\n",
      "But he had the same large, soft eyes as his daughter,--eyes which moved slowly and almost grandly round in their orbits, and were well veiled by their transparent white eyelids. Margaret was more like him than like her mother.\n",
      "This marring of the peace of home, by long hours of discontent, was what Margaret was unprepared for.\n",
      "'You must not be so fastidious, Margaret, dear!' said her mother, secretly thinking of a young and handsome mr Gorman whom she had once met at mr Hume's.\n",
      "The face was in repose; but it was rather rest after weariness, than the serene calm of the countenance of one who led a placid, contented life.\n",
      "Her keen enjoyment of every sensuous pleasure, was balanced finely, if not overbalanced, by her conscious pride in being able to do without them all, if need were.\n",
      "His blue black hair was grey now, and lay thinly over his brows.\n",
      "I wish I knew all about it.\n",
      "Oh! how tired I used to be of the drives every day in Aunt Shaw's carriage, and how I longed to walk!'\n",
      "'But the Gormans were neither butchers nor bakers, but very respectable coach builders.'\n",
      "'No!\n",
      "Master Frederick had been her favorite and pride; and it was with a little softening of her dignified look and manner, that she went in weekly to arrange the chamber as carefully as if he might be coming home that very evening.\n",
      "And when the brilliant fourteen fine days of October came on, her cares were all blown away as lightly as thistledown, and she thought of nothing but the glories of the forest.\n",
      "Her mind and body ached now with the recollection of all she had done and said within the last forty eight hours.\n",
      "She took her mind away with a wrench from the recollection of the past to the bright serene contemplation of the hopeful future.\n",
      "seven.\n",
      "Thanks are also due to my old friend William Scott Palmer, who read part of the manuscript and gave me much generous and valuable advice.\n",
      "Readers of these pages will find nothing about trances, Ecstasies and other rare psychic phenomena; which sometimes indicate holiness, and sometimes only disease.\n",
      "For the same reason, no attention has been given to those abnormal experiences and states of consciousness, which, too often regarded as specially \"mystical,\" are now recognized by all competent students as representing the unfortunate accidents rather than the abiding substance of spirituality.\n",
      "Their treatment in the present work is necessarily fragmentary and suggestive; and is intended rather to stimulate thought, than to offer solutions.\n",
      "My numerous debts to previous writers are obvious, and for the most part are acknowledged in the footnotes; the greatest, to the works of Baron Von Hugely, will be clear to all students of his writings.\n",
      "No conditions being attached to this appointment, it seemed a suitable opportunity to discuss, so far as possible in the language of the moment, some of the implicits which I believe to underlie human effort and achievement in the domain of the spiritual life.\n",
      "It is superfluous to point out that each of these subjects needs, at least, a volume to itself: and to some of them I shall hope to return in the future.\n",
      "Since my subject is not the splendor of historic sanctity but the normal life of the Spirit, as it may be and is lived in the here and now, I have done my best to describe the character and meaning of this life in the ordinary terms of present day thought, and with little or no use of the technical language of mysticism.\n",
      "The succeeding sections of the book treat in some detail the light cast on spiritual problems by mental analysis-a process which need not necessarily be conducted from the standpoint of a degraded materialism-and by recent work on the psychology of autistic thought and of suggestion.\n",
      "Finally, the last chapter attempts to place the fact of the life of the Spirit in its relation to the social order, and to indicate some of the results which might follow upon its healthy corporate development.\n",
      "My aim here is the more general one, of indicating first the characteristic experiences-discoverable within all great religions-which justify or are fundamental to the spiritual life, and the way in which these experiences may be accommodated to the world view of the modern man: and next, the nature of that spiritual life as it appears in human history.\n",
      "PREFACE\n",
      "Part of Chapter four has already appeared in \"The Fortnightly Review\" under the title \"Suggestion and Religious Experience.\" Chapter eight incorporates several passages from an article on \"Sources of Power in Human Life\" originally contributed to the \"Hubert Journal.\" These are reprinted by kind permission of the editors concerned.\n",
      "For information on these matters they must go to larger and more technical works.\n",
      "This book owes its origin to the fact that in the autumn of nineteen twenty one the authorities of Manchester College, Oxford invited me to deliver the inaugural course of a lectureship in religion newly established under the will of the late Professor Upton.\n"

      "1 The squalor and uncleanness of the debtors' side was intensified by constant overcrowding.\n",
      "2 Prisoners were committed to it quite without reference to its capacity.\n",
      "3 No remonstrance was attended to,\n",
      "4 no steps taken to reduce the number of committals, and the governor was obliged to utilize the chapel as a day and night room.\n",
      "5 Besides this, although the families of debtors were no longer permitted to live with them inside the jail,\n",
      "6 hundreds of women and children came in every morning to spend the day there, and there was no limitation whatever to the numbers of visitors admitted to the debtors' side.\n",
      "7 Friends arrived about nine a.m., and went out at nine p.m., when as many as two hundred visitors have been observed leaving the debtors' yards at one time.\n",
      "8 The day passed in revelry and drunkenness. Although spirituous liquors were forbidden,\n",
      "9 wine and beer might be had in any quantity, the only limitation being\n",
      "10 that not more than one bottle of wine or one quart of beer could be issued at one time. No account was taken of the amount of liquors admitted in one day,\n",
      "11 and debtors might practically have as much as they liked, if they could only pay for it.\n",
      "12 No attempt was made to check drunkenness, beyond the penalty of shutting out friends from any ward in which a prisoner exceeded.\n",
      "13 Quarreling among the debtors was not unfrequent. Blows were struck, and fights often ensued.\n",
      "14 For this and other acts of misconduct there was the discipline of the refractory ward, or \"strong room\" on the debtors' side.\n",
      "15 Bad cases were removed to a cell on the felons' side, and here they were locked in solitary confinement for three days at a time.\n",
      "16 Order throughout the debtors' side was preserved\n",
      "17 and discipline maintained by a system open to grave abuses, and which had the prescription of long usage,\n",
      "18 and which was never wholly rooted out for many years to come.\n",
      "19 This was the pernicious plan of governing by prisoners, or of setting a favored few in authority over the many.\n",
      "20 The head of the debtors' prison was a prisoner called the steward, who was chosen by the whole body from six whom the keeper nominated.\n",
      "21 This steward was practically supreme.\n",
      "22 All the allowances of food passed through his hands; he had the control of the poor-box for chance charities,\n",
      "23 he collected the garnish money, and distributed the weekly grant from the prison charitable fund.\n",
      "24 In the latter duties he was, however, supervised by three auditors, freely chosen by the prisoners among themselves.\n",
      "25 The auditors were paid a shilling each for their services each time the poor-box was opened. The steward was also remunerated for his trouble.\n",
      "26 He had a double allowance of bread, deducted, of course, from the already too limited portion of the rest,\n",
      "27 and no doubt made the meat also pay toll.\n",
      "28 Under the steward there were captains of wards, chosen in the same way, and performing analogous duties.\n",
      "29 These subordinate chiefs were also rewarded out of the scanty prison rations.\n",
      "30 The same system was extended to the criminal side, and cases were on record of the place of wardsman being sold for considerable sums.\n",
      "31 So valuable were they deemed, that as much as fifty guineas was offered to the keeper for the post.\n",
      "32 Enough has been said, probably, to prove that there was room for improvement in the condition and treatment of debtors in the prisons of the city of London.\n",
      "33 This gradually was forced upon the consciousness of the Corporation,\n",
      "34 and about eighteen twelve application was made to Parliament for funds to build a new debtors' prison.\n",
      "35 Authority was given to raise money on the Orphans' Fund to the extent of ninety thousand pounds.\n",
      "36 A site was purchased between Red Lion and White Cross streets, and a new prison planned,\n",
      "37 which would accommodate the inmates of Newgate and of the three compters, Ludgate,\n",
      "38 Giltspur Street, and the Poultry, or about four hundred and seventy-six in all.\n",
      "39 The evils of association for these debtors were perpetuated, although the plan provided for the separation of the various contingents committed to it.\n",
      "40 There was no lack of air and light for the new jail, and several exercising yards.\n",
      "41 The completion of this very necessary building was, however, much delayed for want of funds,\n",
      "42 and it was not ready to relieve Newgate till late in eighteen fifteen.\n",
      "43 The reforms which were to be attempted in that prison\n",
      "44 more particularly as regarded the classification of prisoners, and which were dependent on the space to be gained by the removal of the debtors,\n",
      "45 could not be carried out till then. It is to be feared that long after the opening of White Cross Street prison,\n",
      "46 Newgate continued to be a reproach to those responsible for its management.\n",
      "47 I pass now to the criminal side of Newgate, which consisted of the six quarters or yards already enumerated and described.\n",
      "48 The inmates of this part, as distinguished from the debtors, were comprised in four classes:\n",
      "49 (one) those awaiting trial;\n",
      "50 (two) persons under sentence of imprisonment for a fixed period, or until they shall have paid certain fines;\n",
      "51 (three) transports awaiting removal to the colonies, and (four) capital convicts, condemned to death and awaiting execution.\n",
      "52 At one time the whole of these different categories were thrown together pell-mell, young and old, the untried with the convicted.\n",
      "53 An imperfect attempt at classification was, however, made in eighteen twelve, and a yard was as far as possible set apart for the untried,\n",
      "54 or class (one), with whom, under the imperious demand for accommodation, were also associated the misdemeanants, or class (two).\n",
      "55 This was the chapel yard, with its five wards, which were calculated to hold seventy prisoners, but often held many more.\n",
      "56 A further sub-classification was attempted by separating at night those charged with misdemeanors from those charged with felony,\n",
      "57 but all mingled freely during the day in the yard.\n",
      "58 The sleeping accommodation in the chapel-yard wards, and indeed throughout the prison, consisted of a barrack bed,\n",
      "59 which was a wooden flooring on a slightly inclined plane, with a beam running across the top to serve as a pillow.\n",
      "60 No beds were issued, only two rugs per prisoner.\n",
      "61 When each sleeper had the full lateral space allotted to him, it amounted to one foot and a half on the barrack bed;\n",
      "62 but when the ward was obliged to accommodate double the ordinary number, as was frequently the case,\n",
      "63 the sleepers covered the entire floor, with the exception of a passage in the middle.\n",
      "64 All the misdemeanants, whatever their offense, were lodged in this chapel ward.\n",
      "65 As many various and, according to our ideas, heinous crimes came under this head,\n",
      "66 in the then existing state of the law,\n",
      "67 the man guilty of a common assault found himself side by side with the fraudulent, or others who had attempted abominable crimes.\n",
      "68 In this heterogeneous society were also thrown the unfortunate journalists to whom I have already referred, and on whom imprisonment in Newgate\n",
      "69 was frequently adjudged for so-called libels, or too out-spoken comments in print.\n",
      "70 It was particularly recommended by the Committee on Jails in eighteen fourteen\n",
      "71 that some other and less mixed prison should be used for the confinement of persons convicted of libels. But this suggestion was ignored.\n",
      "72 Indeed the partial classification attempted seems to have been abandoned within a year or two.\n",
      "73 The Hon. H. G. Bennet, who visited Newgate in eighteen seventeen, saw in one yard, in a total of seventy-two prisoners,\n",
      "74 thirty-five tried and thirty-seven untried. Of the former, three were transports for life,\n",
      "75 four for fourteen years, and three of them persons sentenced to fines or short imprisonment -- one for little more than a month.\n",
      "76 Two of the untried were for murder, and several for house-breaking and highway robbery.\n",
      "77 Nor were the misdemeanants and bail prisoners any longer separated from those whose crimes were of a more serious character.\n"

      "146 Besides the jail fees, there was garnish of half-a-guinea, collected by the steward,\n",

      "153 Artisans and others were at liberty to work at their trades, provided they were not dangerous.\n",
      "154 Tailoring and shoemaking was permitted, but it was deemed unsafe to allow a carpenter or blacksmith to have his tools.\n",
      "155 All the money earned by prisoners was at their own disposal, and was spent almost habitually in drink, chambering, and wantonness.\n",
      "156 The best accommodation the jail could offer was reserved for the prisoners on the state side,\n",
      "157 from whom still higher fees were exacted, with the same discreditable idea of swelling the revenues of the prison.\n"

      "167 Ten and sixpence a week more was charged as rent for a single bed; where two or more slept in a bed the rent was seven shillings a week each.\n",
      "168 Prisoners who could afford it sometimes paid for four beds, at the rate of twenty-eight shillings, and so secured the luxury of a private room.\n",
      "169 A Mr. Lundy, charged with forgery, was thus accommodated on the state side for upwards of five years.\n",
      "170 But the keeper protested that no single prisoner could thus monopolize space if the state side was crowded.\n",
      "171 The keeper went still further in his efforts to make money.\n",
      "172 He continued the ancient practice of letting out a portion of his own house, and by a poetical fiction treated it as an annex of the state side.\n",
      "173 Mr. Davison, sent to Newgate for embezzlement, and whose case is given in the preceding chapter,\n",
      "174 was accommodated with a room in Mr. Newman's house at the extravagant rental of thirty guineas per week;\n",

      "177 The female felons' wards I shall describe at length in the next chapter,\n",
      "178 which will deal with Mrs. Fry's philanthropic exertions at this period in this particular part of the prison.\n",
      "179 These wards were always full to overflowing; sometimes double the number the rooms could accommodate were crowded into them.\n",
      "180 There was a master's side for females who could pay the usual fees, but they associated with the rest in the one narrow yard common to all.\n",
      "181 The tried and the untried, young and old, were herded together\n",

      "187 The old press yard has been fully described in a previous chapter.\n",
      "188 The name still survived in the new press yard, which was the receptacle of the male condemned prisoners. It was generally crowded, like the rest of the prison.\n",
      "189 Except in murder cases, where the execution was generally very promptly performed,\n",
      "190 strange and inconceivable delay occurred in carrying out the extreme sentence.\n",
      "191 Hence there was a terrible accumulation of prisoners in the condemned cells.\n",
      "192 Once, during the long illness of George the third, as many as one hundred were there waiting the \"Report,\" as it was called.\n",
      "193 At another time there were fifty, one of whom had been under sentence a couple of years.\n",
      "194 Mr. Bennet speaks of thirty-eight capital convicts he found in the press yard in February eighteen seventeen,\n",
      "195 five of whom had been condemned the previous July, four in September, and twenty-nine in October.\n",
      "196 This procrastination bred certain callousness.\n",
      "197 Few realizing that the dreadful fate would overtake them, dismissed the prospect of death,\n",
      "198 and until the day was actually fixed, spent the time in roistering, swearing, gambling, or playing at ball.\n",
      "199 Visitors were permitted access to them without stint;\n",

      "205 and their gibes and jollity counteracted the ordinary's counsels or the independent preacher's earnest prayers.\n",
      "206 For while Roman Catholics and Dissenters were encouraged to see ministers of their own persuasion,\n",
      "207 a number of amateurs were ever ready to give their gratuitous ministrations to the condemned.\n",
      "208 The prisoners in the press yard had free access during the day to the yard and large day room;\n",
      "209 at night they were placed in the fifteen cells, two, three, or more together, according to the total number to be accommodated.\n",
      "210 They were never left quite alone for fear of suicide, and for the same reason they were searched for weapons or poisons.\n",
      "211 But they nevertheless frequently managed to secrete the means of making away with themselves, and accomplished their purpose.\n",
      "212 Convicted murderers were kept continuously in the cells on bread and water,\n",
      "213 in couples, from the time of sentence to that of execution, which was about three or four days generally,\n",
      "214 from Friday to Monday, so as to include one Sunday, on which day there was a special service for the condemned in the prison chapel.\n",
      "215 This latter was an ordeal which all dreaded, and many avoided by denying their faith.\n",
      "216 The condemned occupied an open pew in the center of the chapel, hung with black; in front of them, upon a table, was a black coffin in full view.\n",
      "217 The chapel was filled with a curious but callous congregation, who came to stare at the miserable people thus publicly exposed.\n",

      "219 quote, so discreditable to the metropolis, end quote.\n",
      "220 Yet it must have been abundantly plain to the reader that the other evils existing were great and glaring. A brief summary of them will best prove this.\n",
      "221 The jail was neither suitable nor sufficiently large. It was not even kept weather-tight.\n",

      "225 The rations of food were notoriously inadequate, and so carelessly distributed, that many were left to starve.\n",
      "226 So unjust and unequal was the system, that the allowance to convicted criminals was better than that of the innocent debtor,\n",
      "227 and the general insufficiency was such\n",

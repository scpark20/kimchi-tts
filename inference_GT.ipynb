      "1 The squalor and uncleanness of the debtors' side was intensified by constant overcrowding.\n",
      "2 Prisoners were committed to it quite without reference to its capacity.\n",
      "3 No remonstrance was attended to,\n",
      "4 no steps taken to reduce the number of committals, and the governor was obliged to utilize the chapel as a day and night room.\n",
      "5 Besides this, although the families of debtors were no longer permitted to live with them inside the jail,\n",
      "6 hundreds of women and children came in every morning to spend the day there, and there was no limitation whatever to the numbers of visitors admitted to the debtors' side.\n",
      "7 Friends arrived about nine a.m., and went out at nine p.m., when as many as two hundred visitors have been observed leaving the debtors' yards at one time.\n",
      "8 The day passed in revelry and drunkenness. Although spirituous liquors were forbidden,\n",
      "9 wine and beer might be had in any quantity, the only limitation being\n",
      "10 that not more than one bottle of wine or one quart of beer could be issued at one time. No account was taken of the amount of liquors admitted in one day,\n",
      "11 and debtors might practically have as much as they liked, if they could only pay for it.\n",
      "12 No attempt was made to check drunkenness, beyond the penalty of shutting out friends from any ward in which a prisoner exceeded.\n",
      "13 Quarreling among the debtors was not unfrequent. Blows were struck, and fights often ensued.\n",
      "14 For this and other acts of misconduct there was the discipline of the refractory ward, or \"strong room\" on the debtors' side.\n",
      "15 Bad cases were removed to a cell on the felons' side, and here they were locked in solitary confinement for three days at a time.\n",
      "16 Order throughout the debtors' side was preserved\n",
      "17 and discipline maintained by a system open to grave abuses, and which had the prescription of long usage,\n",
      "18 and which was never wholly rooted out for many years to come.\n",
      "19 This was the pernicious plan of governing by prisoners, or of setting a favored few in authority over the many.\n",
      "20 The head of the debtors' prison was a prisoner called the steward, who was chosen by the whole body from six whom the keeper nominated.\n",
      "21 This steward was practically supreme.\n",
      "22 All the allowances of food passed through his hands; he had the control of the poor-box for chance charities,\n",
      "23 he collected the garnish money, and distributed the weekly grant from the prison charitable fund.\n",
      "24 In the latter duties he was, however, supervised by three auditors, freely chosen by the prisoners among themselves.\n",
      "25 The auditors were paid a shilling each for their services each time the poor-box was opened. The steward was also remunerated for his trouble.\n",
      "26 He had a double allowance of bread, deducted, of course, from the already too limited portion of the rest,\n",
      "27 and no doubt made the meat also pay toll.\n",
      "28 Under the steward there were captains of wards, chosen in the same way, and performing analogous duties.\n",
      "29 These subordinate chiefs were also rewarded out of the scanty prison rations.\n",
      "30 The same system was extended to the criminal side, and cases were on record of the place of wardsman being sold for considerable sums.\n",
      "31 So valuable were they deemed, that as much as fifty guineas was offered to the keeper for the post.\n",
      "32 Enough has been said, probably, to prove that there was room for improvement in the condition and treatment of debtors in the prisons of the city of London.\n",
      "33 This gradually was forced upon the consciousness of the Corporation,\n",
      "34 and about eighteen twelve application was made to Parliament for funds to build a new debtors' prison.\n",
      "35 Authority was given to raise money on the Orphans' Fund to the extent of ninety thousand pounds.\n",
      "36 A site was purchased between Red Lion and White Cross streets, and a new prison planned,\n",
      "37 which would accommodate the inmates of Newgate and of the three compters, Ludgate,\n",
      "38 Giltspur Street, and the Poultry, or about four hundred and seventy-six in all.\n",
      "39 The evils of association for these debtors were perpetuated, although the plan provided for the separation of the various contingents committed to it.\n",
      "40 There was no lack of air and light for the new jail, and several exercising yards.\n",
      "41 The completion of this very necessary building was, however, much delayed for want of funds,\n",
      "42 and it was not ready to relieve Newgate till late in eighteen fifteen.\n",
      "43 The reforms which were to be attempted in that prison\n",
      "44 more particularly as regarded the classification of prisoners, and which were dependent on the space to be gained by the removal of the debtors,\n",
      "45 could not be carried out till then. It is to be feared that long after the opening of White Cross Street prison,\n",
      "46 Newgate continued to be a reproach to those responsible for its management.\n",
      "47 I pass now to the criminal side of Newgate, which consisted of the six quarters or yards already enumerated and described.\n",
      "48 The inmates of this part, as distinguished from the debtors, were comprised in four classes:\n",
      "49 (one) those awaiting trial;\n",
      "50 (two) persons under sentence of imprisonment for a fixed period, or until they shall have paid certain fines;\n",
      "51 (three) transports awaiting removal to the colonies, and (four) capital convicts, condemned to death and awaiting execution.\n",
      "52 At one time the whole of these different categories were thrown together pell-mell, young and old, the untried with the convicted.\n",
      "53 An imperfect attempt at classification was, however, made in eighteen twelve, and a yard was as far as possible set apart for the untried,\n",
      "54 or class (one), with whom, under the imperious demand for accommodation, were also associated the misdemeanants, or class (two).\n",
      "55 This was the chapel yard, with its five wards, which were calculated to hold seventy prisoners, but often held many more.\n",
      "56 A further sub-classification was attempted by separating at night those charged with misdemeanors from those charged with felony,\n",
      "57 but all mingled freely during the day in the yard.\n",
      "58 The sleeping accommodation in the chapel-yard wards, and indeed throughout the prison, consisted of a barrack bed,\n",
      "59 which was a wooden flooring on a slightly inclined plane, with a beam running across the top to serve as a pillow.\n",
      "60 No beds were issued, only two rugs per prisoner.\n",
      "61 When each sleeper had the full lateral space allotted to him, it amounted to one foot and a half on the barrack bed;\n",
      "62 but when the ward was obliged to accommodate double the ordinary number, as was frequently the case,\n",
      "63 the sleepers covered the entire floor, with the exception of a passage in the middle.\n",
      "64 All the misdemeanants, whatever their offense, were lodged in this chapel ward.\n",
      "65 As many various and, according to our ideas, heinous crimes came under this head,\n",
      "66 in the then existing state of the law,\n",
      "67 the man guilty of a common assault found himself side by side with the fraudulent, or others who had attempted abominable crimes.\n",
      "68 In this heterogeneous society were also thrown the unfortunate journalists to whom I have already referred, and on whom imprisonment in Newgate\n",
      "69 was frequently adjudged for so-called libels, or too out-spoken comments in print.\n",
      "70 It was particularly recommended by the Committee on Jails in eighteen fourteen\n",
      "71 that some other and less mixed prison should be used for the confinement of persons convicted of libels. But this suggestion was ignored.\n",
      "72 Indeed the partial classification attempted seems to have been abandoned within a year or two.\n",
      "73 The Hon. H. G. Bennet, who visited Newgate in eighteen seventeen, saw in one yard, in a total of seventy-two prisoners,\n",
      "74 thirty-five tried and thirty-seven untried. Of the former, three were transports for life,\n",
      "75 four for fourteen years, and three of them persons sentenced to fines or short imprisonment -- one for little more than a month.\n",
      "76 Two of the untried were for murder, and several for house-breaking and highway robbery.\n",
      "77 Nor were the misdemeanants and bail prisoners any longer separated from those whose crimes were of a more serious character.\n"

      "84 These twenty-four could just sleep on the barrack bed; when the number was higher, and it often rose to forty, the surplus had to sleep on the floor.\n",

      "159 and no lodger was rejected, whatever his status, who offered himself and could bring grist to the mill.\n",
      "160 The luxury of the state side was for a long time open to all who could pay\n",
      "161 the convicted felon, the transport awaiting removal, the lunatic whose case was still undecided,\n",
      "162 the misdemeanant tried or untried, the debtor who wished to avoid the discomfort of the crowded debtors' side, the outspoken newspaper editor,\n",
      "163 or the daring reporter of parliamentary debates.\n",
      "164 The better class of inmate complained bitterly of this enforced companionship with the vile,\n",
      "165 association at one time forbidden by custom, but which greed and rapacity long made the rule.\n",
      "166 The fee for admission to the state side, as fixed by the table of fees, was three guineas, but Mr. Newman declared that he never took more than two.\n",
      "167 Ten and sixpence a week more was charged as rent for a single bed; where two or more slept in a bed the rent was seven shillings a week each.\n",
      "168 Prisoners who could afford it sometimes paid for four beds, at the rate of twenty-eight shillings, and so secured the luxury of a private room.\n",
      "169 A Mr. Lundy, charged with forgery, was thus accommodated on the state side for upwards of five years.\n",
      "170 But the keeper protested that no single prisoner could thus monopolize space if the state side was crowded.\n",
      "171 The keeper went still further in his efforts to make money.\n",
      "172 He continued the ancient practice of letting out a portion of his own house, and by a poetical fiction treated it as an annex of the state side.\n",
      "173 Mr. Davison, sent to Newgate for embezzlement, and whose case is given in the preceding chapter,\n",
      "174 was accommodated with a room in Mr. Newman's house at the extravagant rental of thirty guineas per week;\n",
      "175 Mr. Cobbett was also a lodger of Mr. Newman's; and so were any members of the aristocracy,\n",
      "176 if they happened to be in funds -- among whom was the Marquis of Sligo in eighteen eleven.\n",
      "177 The female felons' wards I shall describe at length in the next chapter,\n",
      "178 which will deal with Mrs. Fry's philanthropic exertions at this period in this particular part of the prison.\n",
      "179 These wards were always full to overflowing; sometimes double the number the rooms could accommodate were crowded into them.\n",
      "180 There was a master's side for females who could pay the usual fees, but they associated with the rest in the one narrow yard common to all.\n",
      "181 The tried and the untried, young and old, were herded together\n",
      "182 sometimes girls of thirteen, twelve, even ten or nine years of age, were exposed to, quote,\n",
      "183 all the contagion and profligacy which prevailed in this part of the prison, end quote.\n",
      "184 There was no separation even for the women under sentence of death, who lived in a common and perpetually crowded ward.\n",
      "185 Only when the order of execution came down were those about to suffer placed apart in one of the rooms in the arcade of the middle ward.\n",
      "186 I have kept till the last that part of the prison which was usually the last resting-place of so many.\n",
      "187 The old press yard has been fully described in a previous chapter.\n",
      "188 The name still survived in the new press yard, which was the receptacle of the male condemned prisoners. It was generally crowded, like the rest of the prison.\n",
      "189 Except in murder cases, where the execution was generally very promptly performed,\n",
      "190 strange and inconceivable delay occurred in carrying out the extreme sentence.\n",
      "191 Hence there was a terrible accumulation of prisoners in the condemned cells.\n",
      "192 Once, during the long illness of George the third, as many as one hundred were there waiting the \"Report,\" as it was called.\n",
      "193 At another time there were fifty, one of whom had been under sentence a couple of years.\n",
      "194 Mr. Bennet speaks of thirty-eight capital convicts he found in the press yard in February eighteen seventeen,\n",
      "195 five of whom had been condemned the previous July, four in September, and twenty-nine in October.\n",
      "196 This procrastination bred certain callousness.\n",
      "197 Few realizing that the dreadful fate would overtake them, dismissed the prospect of death,\n",
      "198 and until the day was actually fixed, spent the time in roistering, swearing, gambling, or playing at ball.\n",
      "199 Visitors were permitted access to them without stint;\n",
      "200 unlimited drink was not denied them provided it was obtained in regulated quantities at one time.\n",

      "203 I saw Cashman a few hours before his execution, smoking and drinking with the utmost unconcern and indifference, end quote.\n",
      "204 Those who were thus reckless reacted upon the penitent who knew their days were numbered,\n",
      "205 and their gibes and jollity counteracted the ordinary's counsels or the independent preacher's earnest prayers.\n",
      "206 For while Roman Catholics and Dissenters were encouraged to see ministers of their own persuasion,\n",
      "207 a number of amateurs were ever ready to give their gratuitous ministrations to the condemned.\n",
      "208 The prisoners in the press yard had free access during the day to the yard and large day room;\n",
      "209 at night they were placed in the fifteen cells, two, three, or more together, according to the total number to be accommodated.\n",
      "210 They were never left quite alone for fear of suicide, and for the same reason they were searched for weapons or poisons.\n",
      "211 But they nevertheless frequently managed to secrete the means of making away with themselves, and accomplished their purpose.\n",
      "212 Convicted murderers were kept continuously in the cells on bread and water,\n",
      "213 in couples, from the time of sentence to that of execution, which was about three or four days generally,\n",
      "214 from Friday to Monday, so as to include one Sunday, on which day there was a special service for the condemned in the prison chapel.\n",
      "215 This latter was an ordeal which all dreaded, and many avoided by denying their faith.\n",
      "216 The condemned occupied an open pew in the center of the chapel, hung with black; in front of them, upon a table, was a black coffin in full view.\n",
      "217 The chapel was filled with a curious but callous congregation, who came to stare at the miserable people thus publicly exposed.\n",
      "218 Well might Mr. Bennet write that the condition of the condemned side was the most prominent of the manifold evils in the present system of Newgate,\n",
      "219 quote, so discreditable to the metropolis, end quote.\n",
      "220 Yet it must have been abundantly plain to the reader that the other evils existing were great and glaring. A brief summary of them will best prove this.\n",
      "221 The jail was neither suitable nor sufficiently large. It was not even kept weather-tight.\n",
      "222 The roof of the female prison, says the grand jury in their presentment in eighteen thirteen, let in the rain.\n",
      "223 Supplies of common necessaries, such as have now been part of the furniture of every British jail for many years,\n",
      "224 were meager or altogether absent.\n",
      "225 The rations of food were notoriously inadequate, and so carelessly distributed, that many were left to starve.\n",
      "226 So unjust and unequal was the system, that the allowance to convicted criminals was better than that of the innocent debtor,\n",
      "227 and the general insufficiency was such\n",
      "228 that it multiplied beyond all reason the number of visitors, many of whom came merely as the purveyors of food to their friends.\n"

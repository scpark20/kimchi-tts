      "0 The Chronicles of Newgate, Volume two. By Arthur Griffiths. Section five: Newgate down to eighteen eighteen, part two.\n",
      "1 The squalor and uncleanness of the debtors' side was intensified by constant overcrowding.\n",
      "2 Prisoners were committed to it quite without reference to its capacity.\n",
      "3 No remonstrance was attended to,\n",
      "4 no steps taken to reduce the number of committals, and the governor was obliged to utilize the chapel as a day and night room.\n",
      "5 Besides this, although the families of debtors were no longer permitted to live with them inside the jail,\n",
      "6 hundreds of women and children came in every morning to spend the day there, and there was no limitation whatever to the numbers of visitors admitted to the debtors' side.\n",
      "7 Friends arrived about nine a.m., and went out at nine p.m., when as many as two hundred visitors have been observed leaving the debtors' yards at one time.\n",
      "8 The day passed in revelry and drunkenness. Although spirituous liquors were forbidden,\n",
      "9 wine and beer might be had in any quantity, the only limitation being\n",
      "10 that not more than one bottle of wine or one quart of beer could be issued at one time. No account was taken of the amount of liquors admitted in one day,\n",
      "11 and debtors might practically have as much as they liked, if they could only pay for it.\n",
      "12 No attempt was made to check drunkenness, beyond the penalty of shutting out friends from any ward in which a prisoner exceeded.\n",
      "13 Quarreling among the debtors was not unfrequent. Blows were struck, and fights often ensued.\n",
      "14 For this and other acts of misconduct there was the discipline of the refractory ward, or \"strong room\" on the debtors' side.\n",
      "15 Bad cases were removed to a cell on the felons' side, and here they were locked in solitary confinement for three days at a time.\n",
      "16 Order throughout the debtors' side was preserved\n",
      "17 and discipline maintained by a system open to grave abuses, and which had the prescription of long usage,\n",
      "18 and which was never wholly rooted out for many years to come.\n",
      "19 This was the pernicious plan of governing by prisoners, or of setting a favored few in authority over the many.\n",
      "20 The head of the debtors' prison was a prisoner called the steward, who was chosen by the whole body from six whom the keeper nominated.\n",
      "21 This steward was practically supreme.\n",
      "22 All the allowances of food passed through his hands; he had the control of the poor-box for chance charities,\n",
      "23 he collected the garnish money, and distributed the weekly grant from the prison charitable fund.\n",
      "24 In the latter duties he was, however, supervised by three auditors, freely chosen by the prisoners among themselves.\n",
      "25 The auditors were paid a shilling each for their services each time the poor-box was opened. The steward was also remunerated for his trouble.\n",
      "26 He had a double allowance of bread, deducted, of course, from the already too limited portion of the rest,\n",
      "27 and no doubt made the meat also pay toll.\n",
      "28 Under the steward there were captains of wards, chosen in the same way, and performing analogous duties.\n",
      "29 These subordinate chiefs were also rewarded out of the scanty prison rations.\n",
      "30 The same system was extended to the criminal side, and cases were on record of the place of wardsman being sold for considerable sums.\n",
      "31 So valuable were they deemed, that as much as fifty guineas was offered to the keeper for the post.\n",
      "32 Enough has been said, probably, to prove that there was room for improvement in the condition and treatment of debtors in the prisons of the city of London.\n",
      "33 This gradually was forced upon the consciousness of the Corporation,\n",
      "34 and about eighteen twelve application was made to Parliament for funds to build a new debtors' prison.\n",
      "35 Authority was given to raise money on the Orphans' Fund to the extent of ninety thousand pounds.\n",
      "36 A site was purchased between Red Lion and White Cross streets, and a new prison planned,\n",
      "37 which would accommodate the inmates of Newgate and of the three compters, Ludgate,\n",
      "38 Giltspur Street, and the Poultry, or about four hundred and seventy-six in all.\n",
      "39 The evils of association for these debtors were perpetuated, although the plan provided for the separation of the various contingents committed to it.\n",
      "40 There was no lack of air and light for the new jail, and several exercising yards.\n",
      "41 The completion of this very necessary building was, however, much delayed for want of funds,\n",
      "42 and it was not ready to relieve Newgate till late in eighteen fifteen.\n",
      "43 The reforms which were to be attempted in that prison\n",
      "44 more particularly as regarded the classification of prisoners, and which were dependent on the space to be gained by the removal of the debtors,\n",
      "45 could not be carried out till then. It is to be feared that long after the opening of White Cross Street prison,\n",
      "46 Newgate continued to be a reproach to those responsible for its management.\n",
      "47 I pass now to the criminal side of Newgate, which consisted of the six quarters or yards already enumerated and described.\n",
      "48 The inmates of this part, as distinguished from the debtors, were comprised in four classes:\n",
      "49 (one) those awaiting trial;\n",
      "50 (two) persons under sentence of imprisonment for a fixed period, or until they shall have paid certain fines;\n",
      "51 (three) transports awaiting removal to the colonies, and (four) capital convicts, condemned to death and awaiting execution.\n",
      "52 At one time the whole of these different categories were thrown together pell-mell, young and old, the untried with the convicted.\n",
      "53 An imperfect attempt at classification was, however, made in eighteen twelve, and a yard was as far as possible set apart for the untried,\n",
      "54 or class (one), with whom, under the imperious demand for accommodation, were also associated the misdemeanants, or class (two).\n",
      "55 This was the chapel yard, with its five wards, which were calculated to hold seventy prisoners, but often held many more.\n",
      "56 A further sub-classification was attempted by separating at night those charged with misdemeanors from those charged with felony,\n",
      "57 but all mingled freely during the day in the yard.\n",
      "58 The sleeping accommodation in the chapel-yard wards, and indeed throughout the prison, consisted of a barrack bed,\n",
      "59 which was a wooden flooring on a slightly inclined plane, with a beam running across the top to serve as a pillow.\n",
      "60 No beds were issued, only two rugs per prisoner.\n",
      "61 When each sleeper had the full lateral space allotted to him, it amounted to one foot and a half on the barrack bed;\n",
      "62 but when the ward was obliged to accommodate double the ordinary number, as was frequently the case,\n",
      "63 the sleepers covered the entire floor, with the exception of a passage in the middle.\n",
      "64 All the misdemeanants, whatever their offense, were lodged in this chapel ward.\n",
      "65 As many various and, according to our ideas, heinous crimes came under this head,\n",
      "66 in the then existing state of the law,\n",
      "67 the man guilty of a common assault found himself side by side with the fraudulent, or others who had attempted abominable crimes.\n",
      "68 In this heterogeneous society were also thrown the unfortunate journalists to whom I have already referred, and on whom imprisonment in Newgate\n",
      "69 was frequently adjudged for so-called libels, or too out-spoken comments in print.\n",
      "70 It was particularly recommended by the Committee on Jails in eighteen fourteen\n",
      "71 that some other and less mixed prison should be used for the confinement of persons convicted of libels. But this suggestion was ignored.\n",
      "72 Indeed the partial classification attempted seems to have been abandoned within a year or two.\n",
      "73 The Hon. H. G. Bennet, who visited Newgate in eighteen seventeen, saw in one yard, in a total of seventy-two prisoners,\n",
      "74 thirty-five tried and thirty-seven untried. Of the former, three were transports for life,\n",
      "75 four for fourteen years, and three of them persons sentenced to fines or short imprisonment -- one for little more than a month.\n",
      "76 Two of the untried were for murder, and several for house-breaking and highway robbery.\n",
      "77 Nor were the misdemeanants and bail prisoners any longer separated from those whose crimes were of a more serious character.\n",
      "78 Mr. Bennet refers to a gentleman confined for want of bail, who occupied a room with five others\n",
      "79 two committed by the Bankruptcy Commissioner, one for perjury, and two transports.\n"

      "80 Persons convicted of publishing libels were still immured in the same rooms with transports and felons.\n",
      "81 The middle yard, as far as its limits would permit, was appropriated to felons and transports. The wards here were generally very crowded.\n",

      "83 Quote, a common-sized man, says the keeper, Mr. Newman, can turn in nineteen inches, end quote.\n",
      "84 These twenty-four could just sleep on the barrack bed; when the number was higher, and it often rose to forty, the surplus had to sleep on the floor.\n",
      "85 The crowding was in consequence of the delay in removing transports.\n",

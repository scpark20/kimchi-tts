      "\"Here, again, if the practice of leading were retrenched larger type could be used without enhancing the price of a book.\",\n",

      "\"But another point which they should attend to they almost always disregard;\",\n",
      "\"this is the tendency to the formation of ugly meandering white lines or rivers in the page\",\n",
      "\"a blemish which can be nearly, though not wholly, avoided by care and forethought\",\n",
      "\"the desirable thing being the breaking of the line as in bonding masonry or brickwork\",\n",

      "\"The position of the page on the paper should be considered if the book is to have a satisfactory look.\",\n",

      "\"The modern printer, in the teeth of the evidence given by his own eyes, considers the single page as the unit, and prints the page in the middle of his paper\",\n",
      "\"only nominally so, however, in many cases, since when he uses a headline he counts that in,\",\n",
      "\"the result as measured by the eye being that the lower margin is less than the top one, and that the whole opening has an upside-down look vertically\",\n",
      "\"and that laterally the page looks as if it were being driven off the paper.\",\n",
      "\"The paper on which the printing is to be done is a necessary part of our subject:\",\n",
      "\"of this it may be said that though there is some good paper made now,\",\n",
      "\"it is never used except for very expensive books, although it would not materially increase the cost in all but the very cheapest.\",\n",
      "\"The paper that is used for ordinary books is exceedingly bad even in this country, but is beaten in the race for vileness\",\n",
      "\"by that made in America, which is the worst conceivable.\",\n",
      "\"There seems to be no reason why ordinary paper should not be better made,\",\n",
      "\"even allowing the necessity for a very low price; but any improvement must be based on showing openly that the cheap article is cheap,\",\n",
      "\"e.g. the cheap paper should not sacrifice toughness and durability to a smooth and white surface,\",\n",
      "\"which should be indications of a delicacy of material and manufacture which would of necessity increase its cost.\",\n",
      "\"One fruitful source of badness in paper\",\n",

      "\"Previous to that date there had been seven hundred or eight hundred frequently, and once, in Mr. Akerman's time, one thousand.\",\n",
      "\"Trustworthy evidence is forthcoming to the effect that these high figures were constantly maintained for many months at a time.\",\n",

      "\"whose net annual income thus entirely derived from the impecunious amounted to between three and four thousand pounds.\",\n",
      "\"The office of marshal had been hereditary,\",\n",
      "\"but in the twenty-seventh George the second the right of presentation was bought by the Crown for ten thousand, five hundred pounds.\",\n",
      "\"The marshal was supposed to be resident either within the prison or the rules.\",\n",
      "\"He seems to have felt no responsibility as to the welfare or comfort of those in charge, and out of whom he made all his money.\",\n",
      "\"The prison was always in the most filthy state imaginable.\",\n",

      "\"into holes marked with numbers.\",\n",
      "\"How to make most profit out of the wretched denizens of the jail was the marshal's only care. He got a rent for the coffee-house and the bake-house;\",\n",

      "\"The shameful malpractices of Bambridge,\",\n",
      "\"the warden of the Fleet at the commencement of the eighteenth century, are too well known to need more than a passing reference.\",\n",
      "\"A committee of the House of Commons investigated the charges against Bambridge, who was proved to have connived at the escape of some debtors,\",\n",
      "\"and to have been guilty of extortion to others. One Sir William Rich, Bart., he had loaded with heavy irons\",\n",
      "\"In consequence of these disclosures, both Bambridge and Huggin, his predecessor in the office, were committed to Newgate,\",\n",
      "\"and many reforms instituted. But the condition of the prison and its inmates remained unsatisfactory to the last.\",\n",
      "\"It contained generally from six to seven hundred inmates, while another hundred more or less resided in the rules outside.\",\n",
      "\"The principle of chummage prevailed as in the King's Bench,\",\n",

      "\"There was no distinct place for the female debtors, who lived in the same galleries as the men.\",\n",
      "\"Disturbances were frequent, owing to the riotous conduct of intoxicated women.\",\n"

      "\"to be held before the steward of the royal household, the knight marshal, and the steward of the court,\",\n",
      "\"with jurisdiction to hold pleas in all actions within the prescribed limits. The court was chiefly used for the recovery of small debts under ten pounds\",\n",

      "\"The prison was a nest of abuses, like its neighbor the King's Bench\",\n",
      "\"and came under the strong animadversion of the Jail Committee of seventeen twenty-nine.\",\n",
      "\"As the business of the Marshalsea Court declined, the numbers in its prison diminished.\",\n",
      "\"The population, as reported by the committee in eighteen fourteen, averaged about sixty,\",\n",
      "\"and the prison, although wives and children resided within the walls, was not overcrowded.\",\n",
      "\"Their conduct too was orderly on the whole.\",\n",
      "\"Drunkenness was not common, chiefly because liquor was not to be had freely, although the tapster paid a rent of two guineas a week for permission to sell it.\",\n",
      "\"The inmates, who euphemistically styled themselves collegians,\",\n",
      "\"were governed by rules which they themselves had framed, and under which subscriptions were levied\",\n",

      "\"A court of the collegians was held every Monday to manage its affairs, at which all prisoners were required to attend.\",\n",
      "\"A committee of collegians was elected to act as the executive, also a secretary or accountant to receive monies and keep books,\",\n",

      "\"Bad language, quarreling, throwing water over one another was forbidden on pain of fine and being sent to Coventry;\",\n",

      "\"His bequest, which was charged upon his manor at Goring, Oxon, and hence called the Oxford Charity,\",\n",

      "\"The supreme control of the Marshalsea was vested in the marshal of the royal household; but although he drew a salary of five hundred pounds a year,\",\n",
      "\"he did nothing beyond visiting the prison occasionally, and left the administration to the deputy marshal.\",\n",

      "\"The compters of Ludgate, Giltspur Street, and the Borough were discontinued as debtors' prisons (as was Newgate also)\",\n",

      "\"At one time the Ludgate debtors, accompanied by the keeper,\",\n",
      "\"went outside and beyond the prison to call on their creditors, and try to arrange their debts, but this practice was discontinued.\",\n",
      "\"There were fifteen rooms of various sizes, and as the numbers imprisoned rarely exceeded five-and-twenty, the place was never overcrowded,\",\n",

      "\"The demands for fees were excessive in Giltspur Street.\",\n",
      "\"Those who could not pay were thrown into the wards with the night charges,\",\n",
      "\"and denied admission to the charity wards, which partook of all the benefits of bequests and donations to poor debtors.\",\n",
      "\"The Borough Compter was in a disgraceful state to the last. The men's ward had an earth, or rather a mud, floor,\",\n",
      "\"and was so unfit to sleep on that it had not been used for many years, so that the men and women associated together indiscriminately.\",\n",
      "\"The rooms had no fireplaces, so it mattered little that no coals were allowed.\",\n",
      "\"There were no beds or bedding, no straw even.\",\n",

      "\"Neild found the prisoners in the Borough Compter ragged, starving, and dirty.\",\n",
      "\"I come now to the debtors in Newgate. The quarters they occupied were divided, as I have said, into three principal divisions\",\n",
      "\"the master's side, the cabin side, and the common side. Payment of a fee of three shillings gained the debtor admission to the two first named;\",\n",
      "\"those who could pay nothing went, as a matter of course, to the common side;\",\n",
      "\"a further fee was, however, demanded from the new-comer before he was made free of either the master's or the cabin side.\",\n",
      "\"This was the reprehensible claim for garnish, which had already been abolished in all well-conducted prisons, but which still was demanded in Newgate.\",\n",
      "\"Garnish on the cabin side was a guinea at entrance for coals, candles, brooms, etc., and a gallon of beer on discharge;\",\n",
      "\"on the master's side it was thirteen and fourpence, and a gallon of beer on entrance, although Mr. Newman,\",\n",
      "\"in his evidence in eighteen fourteen, said it was more,\",\n",
      "\"and gave the garnish for the common side at that sum, which is five shillings more than Mr. Neild says was extorted on the common side.\",\n",
      "\"Numerous tyrannies were practiced on all who would not and could not pay the garnish.\",\n",
      "\"They were made to wash and swab the ward, or they were shut out from the ward fireplace, and forbidden to pass a chalked line drawn on the floor,\",\n",
      "\"and so were unable either to warm themselves or to cook their food.\",\n",
      "\"Besides these fees, legitimate and illegitimate, there were others which must be paid before release.\",\n",
      "\"The sheriff demanded four shillings, six pence for his liberate, the jailer six shillings, ten pence more, and the turnkey two shillings;\",\n",
      "\"and thus when the debtor's debt had been actually paid, or when he had abandoned his property to the creditors, and, almost destitute,\",\n",
      "\"looked forward to his liberty, he was still delayed until he had paid a new debt arising, quote,\",\n",
      "\"only out of a satisfaction of all his former debts, end quote. The fees were not always extorted, it is true;\",\n",
      "\"nor was non-payment made a pretext for further imprisonment, thanks to the humanity of the jailer, or the funds provided by various charities.\",\n",
      "\"There was this much honest forbearance in Newgate in these days,\",\n",
      "\"that debtors who could afford the cabin and master's side were not permitted to share in the prison charities.\",\n",
      "\"These were lumped together into a general fund,\",\n",
      "\"and a calculation made as to the amount that might be expended per week from the whole sum, so that the latter might last out the year.\",\n",
      "\"It generally ran to about six pounds per week. The money, which at one time had been distributed quarterly, and all went in drink,\",\n",
      "\"was after eighteen oh seven, through the exertions of the keeper of the jail, spent in the purchase of necessaries.\",\n",
      "\"But this weekly pittance did not go far when the debtors' side was crowded, as it often was;\",\n",
      "\"notably as when numbers filled Newgate in anticipation of Lord Redesdale's bill for insolvent debtors,\",\n",
      "\"and there were as many as three hundred and fifty prisoners in at one time.\",\n",
